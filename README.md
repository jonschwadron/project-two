# project-two

### So I need to build a Reddit Style forum for project 2.

# TODO
- delete post - do a check if currentUser matches the commentor's author.
- edit post - do a check if currentUser matches commentor's author.
- karma/rating/thumbs up system
- sorting... based on popularity.

# TODO (if you have time...)
- add a time limit for each post and indicate the time remaining. after the time is up, archive the posts and move the trailing post up.
