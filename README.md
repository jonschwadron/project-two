# project-two

### So I need to build a Reddit Style forum for project 2.

# TODO
- delete post - do a check if currentUser matches author.
- edit post - do a check if currentUser matches author.
- karma/rating/thumbs up system
- add comment (reply to new post)
- when clicking your currentUser name on the nav menu, it should redirect you to the list of all the comments you have created.
